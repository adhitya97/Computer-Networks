Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

DHCP Server
	Any computer in a network can make a request to the DHCP for an IP Address. The DHCP Server assigns an IP for every computer which makes the request.
	Runs in the Application Layer
	
The node which needs an IP Address sends a 'DHCP Discover Message'. The DHCP Server sends the 'DHCP Offer'.
The messages that are sent are broadcast message.

Contents of a DHCP Discover Message:
	<SMAC;DMAC;SIP;Data;CRC Bytes>
		SMAC - MAC of node
		DMAC - MAC of DHCP Server (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF - Since actual MAC of the DHCP server in unknown, message is broadcast (Data Link Layer))
		SIP - IP of node (0.0.0.0 - Since the node does not have an IP yet)
		DIP - IP of the DHCP Server (255.255.255.255 - Since actual IP of the DHCP server in unknown, message is broadcast (IP Layer))
		Data - DHCP Discover

Contents of a DHCP Offer:
	<SMAC;DMAC;SIP;Data;CRC Bytes>
		SMAC - MAC of DHCP Server
		DMAC - MAC of node
		SIP - IP of DHCP Server
		DIP - IP of the node (255.255.255.255 - Since actual IP of the node in unknown (0.0.0.0), message is broadcast (IP Layer))
		Data - DHCP Offer (Contains the IP address to be assigned to the node. The IP is valid for 300 seconds)

DHCP Request -
	This is sent by the client node. When multiple DHCP Servers are available, a DHCP request is sent by the client (broadcast); this lets the DHCP Servers know that a node has chosen a particular DHCP Server.

DHCP Acknowledge - 
	The DHCP Server sends the acknowledge message to the client. This is also broadcast (to let all the nodes in the network know that a new node has joined the network)

Surrender the IP Address - "ipconfig /release" (IP becomes 0.0.0.0 after this)
To renew IP Address (new request) - "ipconfig /renew" (We get an IP after this)
Wireshark Display Filter for DHCP related messages- "bootp"
Then, we make a new request.

Source Port (Client)- 68
Destination Port (DHCP Server) - 67


DHCP messages are sent over UDP.

Relay Agent - 
	When the Client and DHCP Server are not part of the same network.Therefore, we need an agent which would forward the message to DHCP Server and vice versa.

The DHCP Server tells us where the router is.

IP Address Lease Time - 1 Day.
